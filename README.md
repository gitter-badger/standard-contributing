# Standard Contributing

A standard style for CONTRIBUTING files.

A CONTRIBUTING file tells your audience how to participate in your project. For example, you might include information on:

* How to file a bug report (try using [issue and pull request templates](https://github.com/blog/2111-issue-and-pull-request-templates))
* How to suggest a new feature
* How to set up your environment and run tests

(The above is from the [Open Source Guides](http://opensource.guide/))
